# TryHackMe Writeups

---

TryHackMe is a fast-growing comprehensive online platform that provides hands-on exercises and labs about cyber security. This platform can help with individuals who are novice to this field, as well as individuals who are mastering their existing skills.

TryHackMe also features more than 600 rooms, mainly consisting of capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and you can access most of these at no cost! There are even learning paths that you can choose, in any order you wish, whether it be based on what you are aiming to be career-wise, or just for curiosity.

As you progress in learning using TryHackMe, as well as other alternatives, you can definitely gain a lot of knowledge and expertise, over time, that can potentially be useful towards real-life environments.

This repository contains all the rooms, along with my [writeups](/writeups), for which there are different links to if interested.
