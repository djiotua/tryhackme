# About _writeups_

---

This folder contains all my possible writeups for rooms from TryHackMe. There are links to the actual rooms, if you would like to have a go at any order you like, or are stuck, as well as my writeups. These rooms are sorted by the level of difficulty.

Note that with my answers and explanations, it is recommended to look at my explanations before looking at the answers, so as to better understand how things work.
